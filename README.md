The game screen supports the following functionality:
- **Reset:** resets the board to the original state.
- **Restart:** returns player to the welcome screen.
- **Exit:** closes the application.

A player can select a cell by clicking on it, which will highlight that cell in red. Once a cell is selected, the player can enter a number, which will sketch that value into the cell. Pressing enter on a highlighted cell with a sketched value will finalize that value in the cell. At any point in time, a player may highlight a cell with a sketched or finalized value and press the Backspace key to remove that value. The image below shows a cell with a sketched value.
